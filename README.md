`kenworthy` contains libraries written for astronomy by Matthew Kenworthy.

These include:

`kepler3` provides a fast and simple set of routines to estimate Hill sphere sizes, orbital periods and velocities at periastron and apastron, which enable characterisation of complex (i.e. not a simple exoplanet transit) eclipses.

`exorings3` models giant ring-like structures transiting stellar disks, and provides fast calculation of light curves for forward modeling. Drawing routines for making figures of exoring systems in matplotlib are optimised with `Artist` primitives.
 
`isocosa` generates points on a unit sphere based on the isocosahedron suitable for modeling the surface of a star or planet

`tag_plot` label your plots with the name of the plotting script and the current date so that you can find it again in the future
